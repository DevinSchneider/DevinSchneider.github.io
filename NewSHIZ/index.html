                <h3>Key History</h3>
                <ul>
                    The violin was invented during 16th century in northern Italy. The earliest makers were Andrea Amati and Gasparo da Salò.
                     The violin is a member of the string family, which also includes the viola, cello, and double bass. The violin is the smallest
                     and highest-pitched member of the family. The violin is played with a bow, which is drawn across the strings to produce sound.
                      The violin is used in a wide variety of musical styles, including classical, jazz, folk, and pop music.
